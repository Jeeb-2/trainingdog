                                <p class="special">Hi! My name is Tyrese Evans
                                    and I just love teaching people how to enjoy
                                    their dogs more by making sure their dogs
                                    understand them. Dog Training
                                    is very special to me because not only am I
                                    teaching dogs foundational
                                    skills but in some cases I am helping save
                                    some dogs’ lives by training
                                    them and helping owners work on building a
                                    strong relationship with their
                                    dogs.
                                </p>
                                <p>I attended school for professional dog
                                    training and behavior science and
                                    during that time I completed an internship
                                    at an established dog training
                                    company and volunteered at the Humane
                                    Society. Once I graduated, I
                                    chose to open my own dog training business
                                    because I wanted to give
                                    every client their desired results along
                                    with a great experience, which
                                    includes honesty, hard work, patience, and a
                                    game plan to achieve their
                                    goals. </p>
                                <p>During my free time I love to hang out with
                                    my dogs Beau and Arrow. I
                                    enjoy taking them swimming, playing fetch,
                                    going on car rides and just
                                    letting them relax with tasty chew treats.
                                    Training should be fun and not stressful so
                                    for training done right, just
                                    reach out so that we can have A Howling Good

                                            to

                                            Consistency is key. Rewards can
                                            include treats,
